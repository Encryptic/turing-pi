# My turing-pi setup

This repo represents everything I've done to my Turing Pi 2 cluster for testing. This repo isn't a resource for most people, and you'd probably be more interested in [Jeff Geerling's Pi Cluster](https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-cluster). Many of the pieces of Ansible are from Jeff's work.
